Canonical source: matches the checked attempt.

A broader-report override selects a separately preserved retry receipt; it does not relax scope, checked-attempt identity, exact agreement, worker health or memory checks. 

Fresh frontend/backend workers are serial with 1024 MiB V8 heap allowances and 4 MiB stacks. Heap limits are not RSS limits; root supervises process-tree memory separately. Retained reference acquisitions keep their original resource provenance.

Installation, installed verification and 42 CLI checks remain separate post-install actions. Measurement/regression admission and independent release review remain separate decisions. All missing/invalid reports and exact errors are retained in gates.json.
