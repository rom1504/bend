In the post-AGI economy, humans will eventually stop writing and reading code,
but we still need an ambiguity-free language to communicate our intents to the
AIs building the world around us. Bend is that language.

With **laws**, intents can be more precise than natural language. With
**proofs**, we can mechanically verify the AI implemented our prompts correctly.
And with a **fast compiler**, we can run that code at peak compute.

That's Bend - and nothing else.

## Compiler written in Bend

This fork ships the Bend2 compiler in [`selfhost/`](selfhost/README.md), targeting
upstream **`0592662` (Bend 2.0.36)**. Ordinary compilation runs Bend algorithms
without a TypeScript fallback.

**Phase67 is installed and verified.** Checked B1 is `c76f1113…`; genuine B2
`cbffd1f8…` checks its own source and reproduces B3 exactly. Direct JavaScript
is the default; legacy JS and native C retain documented limits.

Six native diagnostic families run **1.50× faster**, with **20% smaller C** and
**18% less Clang build time**. The remaining native gap is **10.41× upstream**
on this limited corpus. A reusable execution-only loop checks all six families
in **7 seconds**, plus initial setup/hashing; new C acquisition is separate.

JavaScript outputs remain byte-identical across all 45 benchmark points.
Phase66's last full campaign measured **1.049× upstream JS runtime** and
**1.402× / 1.321× TypeScript compilation time** for B1/B2 (including imports:
0.983× / 0.990×). Phase67's short B1/B2 screens show no regression; they do not
replace those broad historical measurements.

The unchanged frontend/JS executable closure retains 3,174 exact frontend
observations and 1,045 golden JS passes, with 123 exemptions, one shared process
failure and one graphics deferral. Thirteen native API gaps remain. Maintained
Bend source is **28,536 physical lines in 115 modules** (+46 lines this phase).
The proof pilot is accepted by both Bend checkers; independent kernel checking
is blocked by the available Lean version. It is not a proof of the compiler.

## Bend runs FAST

**Target:** be as fast as C on the CPU, as fast as CUDA on the GPU. **Status:**

<p align="center"><img src="media/runtime.gif" width="640" alt="Runtime benchmarks: Bend vs C, TypeScript, Lean, on 1 core, 16 cores and the GPU"></p>

Thanks to strong types, purity and linearity, Bend compiles to fast executables
as fast as hand-written C (single-core), and even faster (on 10000s cores). The
entire language runs on the GPU, with full memory unification.

## Bend checks FAST

**Target:** outperform every proof assistant by several OOMs. **Status:**

<p align="center"><img src="media/checker.gif" width="640" alt="Checker benchmarks: Bend vs Isabelle, Agda, Lean, Rocq"></p>

Bend's compiler is so powerful it can verify mathematical proofs. Usually, this
is slow. Bend is not. It checks, in under a second, files that other projects
would take minutes, making proofs way more practical.

## Bend is PARALLEL

No threads, no locks, no kernels to write. Split the work in two, and Bend
spreads the calls over every core it can find, then joins them back. Below,
`pow2(20)` divides until one task sits on each of 4,096 GPU cores:

## Bend BLOCKS mistakes - with proof

PROBLEM: How can you **trust** AI code, without reading it?

SOLUTION: By forcing your AI to write a **correctness proof**.

Bend introduces `LAWS.bend`, a file where you declare rules that your app must
not break. Bend's compiler then **guarantees** that these laws always hold, by
demanding **mathematical proof** whenever your code is edited. For example,
consider a game with one law: *winning is impossible*. Here's how it plays out:

<p align="center"><b>Law</b>: winning is <b>impossible</b><br><img src="media/game_law.gif" width="480" alt="The player walks up and bumps the wall of the flag's room"><br><i>So far, it works!</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>New feature:</b> "Claude, make the board wrap around"</p>

<p align="center"><b>Without LAWS.bend:</b><br><img src="media/game_bug.gif" width="480" alt="The player wraps around the edge and takes the flag"><br><i>Laws broken. AI mistake: <b>merged</b>.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>With LAWS.bend:</b><br><img src="media/game_law_kept.gif" width="480" alt="A wall on the far edge stops the player"><br><i>Laws intact. AI mistake: <b>blocked</b>!</i></p>

Without `LAWS.bend`, a bug was merged. With it, the AI had to retry, until no
bugs were left! In this case, it added a wall, but it could have moved the flag,
made the room kill you, or whatever. The only thing it can't do is commit a bug,
because it is **mathematically impossible** to break laws in `LAWS.bend`. The
compiler *enforces* it.

Using `LAWS.bend` is simple.

1. Ask your AI to formalize your app's rules in `LAWS.bend`. Example:

    - LAW: *"the sum of all balances must be zero"*

    - LAW: *"players can never pass through solid walls"*

    - LAW: *"list_sort() must always return ascending numbers"*

    - LAW: *"array_set() may never be called out-of-bounds"*

    - LAW: *"winning is impossible"* (the demo above!)

    - And so on. Anything you can spell can become a law.

2. Ask your AI to run `bend PROOF.bend` after editing any code.

3. That's it. Rejoice as your app never again breaks or violates your rules.

You can also edit `LAWS.bend` yourself. Here's how it looks:

```python
# LAWS.bend
law you_cant_win:                           # "winning is impossible"
  for moves: List<Game.Move>                # any sequence of moves
  board = Game.replay(Game.start(), moves)  # replayed from the start
  {Game.is_won(board) == False{} : Bool}    # never leads to victory
```

```python
# PROOF.bend
def Laws.you_cant_win(moves):
  # ... written by the AI
```

In short, `LAWS.bend` is `AGENTS.md` backed by **proof**.

With `LAWS.bend`, *"make no mistakes"* becomes enforceable.

# Get Started

### 1. Install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bend-lang.com/install.sh | sh
```

This `bend` ignores a project's `bunfig.toml` and `.env`; `bun bend2/main.ts`
from a checkout reads them, so check untrusted code with `bend`.

### 2. Tell your agent to use Bend:

Add this to your `AGENTS.md`:

```
When using Bend:
- run `bend guide` to learn it
- use `LAWS.bend` to keep important rules
- run `bend PROOF.bend` before committing
- parallelize the code whenever possible
```

Then, just say: "use Bend"!

### 3. Enjoy bug-free, fast vibe-coded apps!

Hints:

- Ask it to write laws for anything that can't break.

- Ask it to parallelize anything you want to be fast.

- Bend is young. If anything goes wrong, ask it to open an issue. <3

Bend works best on the back-end, on Linux or macOS.

# Examples

### Syntax == Python + dependent types

```python
import Base

# Performs effects on the CPU.
def main() -> IO(Unit):
  do IO<Unit>:
    name : String <- IO.try(String, IO.get_env("USER"))
    IO.print("Hello, " ++ name)
```

### Parallelism == divide-and-conquer

```python
import Base

# Computes 2^d in parallel: a tree of d levels, one leaf per unit.
def pow2(+d: Nat) -> U32:
  match d:
    case 0n:
      1
    case 1n+p:
      a b = pow2(p) pow2(p)
      (a + b : U32)

# Runs pow2 on the GPU, via `!`.
def main() -> IO(Unit):
  result = pow2!(20n)
  IO.print(U32.show(result))
```

### Theorems == laws, Proofs == defs

```python
import Base

# CLAIM: for every nat x, x + 0 equals x.
law add_zero:
  for x: Nat
  {Nat.add(x, 0n) == x : Nat}

# PROOF: induction on `x`, one rewrite (`%`) per step.
def add_zero(x):
  match x:
    case 0n:
      {==}
    case 1n+xp:
      %add_zero(xp) : {1n+Nat.add(xp, 0n) == 1n+_ : Nat}
      {==}
```

# Limitations

```
- Bend 2 is a new language. Bend 1 programs and HVM do not carry over.
- Everything is annotated and nothing is inferred, so code is verbose.
- No type classes, no traits, and no macros beyond compile-time templates.
- Bend has no tactics or proof search; proving theorems takes extra effort.
- Values are affine: closures and arrays cannot be shared.
- Recursion must terminate; `@unsafe` or `def f?(..)` turns the check off.
- Computed matches (`match f(x)`) aren't supported. Must split it manually.
- There is no syntax for if-then-else: a branch is a match on True and False.
- Numbers are Nat, U32 and F32 only: no U64, I64 or F64 (Metal has no f64).
- F32 is axiomatic: nothing about floating point can be proven.
- Strings are linked lists of characters, so text processing is slow.
- Base is small: expect to write helpers other languages ship built in.
- Effects are few: print, env, time, sleep, spawn, channels, files, TCP, UDP.
- No TLS, HTTP library, JSON or regex for now (you can add them as foreigns).
- Targets are C, Metal, CUDA and JavaScript; Lua, Luau and Python are planned.
- The JavaScript target runs on one core and has no graphics or audio.
- Parallelism requires balanced calls. Flexible parallelism will be added later.
- Atomic arrays shared across threads are experimental and need `@unsafe`.
- One GPU per program, one event loop, and no multi-machine execution yet.
- One C file per program: no separate compilation, no incremental builds.
- Compiling to native is slow (clang/CUDA/Metal). For fast development, use JS.
- The compiler is young and has blind spots (unusually slow programs). Report.
- We don't have as many benchmarks as we'd like yet, especially for the checker.
- The compiler (not kernel) is 99% AI-written and not yet fully audited.
- The checker has no proof and may have bugs; `--verdict` uses a proven kernel.
- A binary needs clang 14+; ! needs 19+, Metal or CUDA 12.
- No Windows (WSL works); on Linux, Window and Audio need X11 and ALSA headers.
- A hub package is a hash, unless its author names and versions it after `bend login`.
- Error messages are terse; no debugger, profiler or REPL.
- The editor tool only formats; the community bend2-lsp adds errors and hover.
- No test framework and no documentation beyond the guide.
- And more that escape me. Be patient, report bugs and request features!

Most of these limitations are being addressed and will improve over time!
