# Phase 5 development workflow

For ordinary use and rebuilding the shipped compiler, start with the
[consolidated compiler guide](BEND-IN-BEND.md). `npm run build` composes this
workflow with verified equality derivation and installation; `npm run
verify:release` checks the installed package. The commands below retain isolated
attempts for experiments without replacing the default.

Use a genuinely checked B1 for routine compiler edits. The maintained entry
freezes the source, runtime and host, builds the API, prepares its own validated
Base cache, and runs selected cases against pinned TypeScript. Compiler work
still executes the compiler written in Bend. The [design](../design/phase5/conformance_and_development.md)
defines the broader integration gates.

From `selfhost/`, create a small configuration, with paths relative to that file:

```json
{
  "upstream": ".bootstrap/upstream",
  "jobs": 1,
  "cpu": "3"
}
```

Then run Node 24 with a new attempt directory:

```sh
node tools/development/workflow.mjs run development.json build/dev/attempt-01
```

The default selection is the existing 21 frontend acceptance/rejection-phase
witnesses. It does not assert exact diagnostic agreement. Supply `"selection"`
to choose exact upstream probes or custom fixtures using the
[selected harness format](PHASE2_DEVELOPMENT.md#select-exact-upstream-probes).
Parse/check selections reuse persistent workers; a selection containing an
execution lane uses isolated workers. Emitter/runtime changes need applicable
compile-and-execute witnesses, not only frontend cases.

To test changed fixtures without rebuilding that compiler:

```sh
node tools/development/workflow.mjs validate build/dev/attempt-01 \
  my-selection.json build/dev/validation-02
```

Every validation directory must be new. This command verifies the original
checked API, source snapshot, runtime, helpers and bootstrap evidence before
reuse. It continues to test that frozen compiler even if the working source
has since changed; run a new build attempt to test compiler edits. It discovers
fresh fixture graphs and retains failed reproductions and replay histories.

`build.json` records the checked build phase. `attempt.json` identifies the
immutable compiler and its genuine `.bootstrap.json`. Each validation has its
own `report.json`, paired reference/candidate reports and command logs.
`complete` means that the requested observations finished with stable inputs;
`pass` describes their strict/explicit-oracle result. Exact diagnostic
differences are counted separately. Nonzero exit remains nonzero, including
known strict failures. These reports never imply full-language conformance.
The CLI summary includes `exactDifferences`; set `"strictExact": true` to also
require zero exact reference/candidate differences, even for custom acceptance
oracles. By default those oracles retain their declared acceptance/phase scope.

An interrupted bootstrap is not reusable: inspect its logs and choose a new
attempt. If `attempt.json` identifies a completed verified build but validation
was interrupted, use `validate` with a fresh destination. No partial worker
history is silently resumed or overwritten.

Set `"fullFrontend": true` for the full candidate parse/check inventory after
the focused paired gate passes. Use `"jobs": 4` and a mask of four available
physical cores, for example `"cpu": "0,1,2,3"`, only when those resources are
available. All workers share the mask. The full report preserves existing
conformance failures, so complete coverage can still exit nonzero. Live pinned
TypeScript is run for the focused selection; the optional full inventory is a
candidate gate, not a second paired full sweep.

Resource options are `timeoutMs` per probe (default 120,000, maximum 300,000),
`phaseTimeoutMs` for selected validation (default 900,000), `fullTimeoutMs`
(default 3,600,000), `heapMb` per process (default/maximum 4,096), and
`recycleAfter` (default 64). Bootstrap and Base preparation each have a
180-second outer deadline. The unchanged bootstrap currently gives its stage0
child a 120-second deadline and its existing Node resource policy; workflow
parent flags are not claimed to propagate to that nested child. Deadlines,
spawn failures and output overflow retain failed reports. Choose a smaller
selection before increasing a deadline.

The optional `"profile": "equality"` delegates to the separate checked-B1
equality derivation helper. It retains the untouched checked API and records a
distinct derived artifact. Unknown bodies or missing provenance are refused.
The focused workflow gate and a full2,756-observation frontend gate pass for this
route; `"checked"` remains the default. On the frozen second integration, an
exclusive four-core ABBA comparison reduced mean full frontend wall from301.9
to229.8seconds (23.9%), retaining every known failure. This is an artifact-specific
workflow result, not a general compiler or generated-program speed claim; see
the [controlled comparison](../implementation/phase5/equality-frontend.md).
See the [workflow evidence](../implementation/phase5/development-workflow.md)
for the exact tested scope and retained diagnostic differences.

Persistent parse/check workers now privately reuse decoded Base data after
verifying the complete cache bytes and compiler/Base identities on each request.
A changed or invalid cache clears the entry before normal validation; the book
is immutable and source graphs remain per-request. This requires no user setting.
Public single-request compilation and program execution keep their existing
paths. A controlled full-inventory comparison on one frozen checked compiler
reduced mean wall from 292.6 to 242.6 seconds (17.1%), with every observation and
worker history unchanged. See [the cache policy and gates](../implementation/phase5/persistent-base-decoding.md).
The equality and Base-memo percentages come from separate comparisons and must
not be multiplied to claim an unmeasured combined gain.

On the final Phase 5 source, the [controlled complete-source comparison](../implementation/phase5/full-source-comparison.md)
measures mean process wall of 60.25 seconds for pinned TypeScript, 642.58 seconds
for checked B1 and 363.39 seconds for its maintained equality derivative. All six
compilations pass checking, output-byte and execution gates. Bend uses validated
disk Base caches while TypeScript reloads/checks Base, so the 6.03× derivative/TS
ratio describes these workflows. This is a long integration workload; use the
focused commands above for ordinary edits. It does not measure public self-emitted
H or establish faster runtime for generated user programs.
