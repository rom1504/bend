# Compiler validation

## Phase45 installed worker23 validation

**Phase45 worker23 is installed; release verification and all 42 CLI checks pass.**
API SHA256: `e77c504a9c91d9ae9d43e52f4f4899711eb7a8ebe707ee565348df2708488b4c`.
Runtime SHA256: `4f057842e476d01be5cfa06ad7984fea55ad2537b2fe6e861965a782e8b94c26`.
The pin remains `018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`.
This is a checked B1 derivative, not a new self-emitted fixed point. Worker22
shares the API hash but has a different runtime; selected-image receipts bind
both hashes and the exact checked attempt.

Fresh selected observations agree exactly on 3,026 main and 196 broader frontend
inputs with zero result or extra-field differences. Main outcomes remain
2,525 pass / 497 observed / four shared failures; broader remains 195 pass / one
observed. All 81 retained backend observations agree: 69 execution passes, eight
unavailable or not-applicable outcomes and four shared check failures. Verified
pinned TypeScript reference observations are reused; agreement does not turn
shared failures into passes.

The eight maintained suites and fresh Phase44 composition fixture pass. The
selected Phase45 mechanism queue freshly acquires seven fixture families and
runs twelve controls, including five separate 50,000-depth worker roots at the
default 984KiB Node stack. Coverage includes cyclic/acyclic calls, bounded fallback,
tail transfer, Number-Nat arithmetic/overflow, mutable public descriptors,
immutable results, actual records and used/unused primitive guards. Separate
fresh nullary controls cover six value oracles, 39 boundaries, six activation
observations and nine metadata bundles; Unit controls cover 27 oracles, four
activation observations, ten boundaries and two public ABI bundles. Six exact-entry
host-hook observations agree with ordinary source invocation. Their scopes
intentionally overlap and must not be summed as unique language tests.

The [Phase45 report](../implementation/phase45/README.md) and
[selected qualification](tools/performance/phase45/evidence/selected-qualification.json)
record standard gates; [fresh mechanisms](tools/performance/phase45/evidence/selected-mechanisms.json)
and separate focused receipts retain their own scopes. A preserved failed
Number-Nat probe remains counter-evidence and receives no qualification credit.
Historical Phase44/43 owner campaigns below are not relabeled as fresh Phase45 checks.
Generated execution, compiler cost and CLI installation remain separate evidence.
Full backend/GPU execution, universal host equivalence and independent proof
validity remain unestablished; `--verdict` is unsupported.

## Historical Phase44 installed checked04 validation

**Phase44 checked04 was installed; release verification and all 42 CLI checks passed.** Its API SHA256 is
`0d3325425139c59ac81c4f1bca19fa09e9f977062aa3b202c0ef1c8c7b56b0ea`.
The upstream pin remains `018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`.
This is a checked B1 derivative, not a new self-emitted fixed point.

Fresh candidate observations agree exactly on 3,026 main and 196 broader frontend
inputs, with zero result or extra-field differences. Main outcomes remain
2,525 pass / 497 observed / four shared failures; broader remains 195 pass / one
observed. Backend qualification agrees on all 81 retained observations: 69
execution passes, eight unavailable or not-applicable cases and four shared check
failures. Only verified pinned TypeScript reference observations are reused.
Agreement does not convert shared failures into passes.

All eight maintained suites pass: IR contracts, basic emission, global
initializers, choices, matcher arms, primitive guards, constructor provenance and
foreign boundaries. These include 37 IR controls with transformation activation,
1,129 primitive admission assertions, 25 primitive order/ABI observations and ten
user constructors with primitive names. A freshly compiled independent composition
fixture passes 35 scalar oracles, four mixed-feature points, eleven public boundary
observations and 26 higher-order observations. These scopes overlap and are not
summed into a unique-test total.

The [Phase44 report](../implementation/phase44/README.md) records exact selected
artifacts, source changes, experiment failures and remaining compatibility nodes.
Phase43's 34-owner and composite postinstall campaigns below are historical
qualification; they are not relabeled as freshly run Phase44 gates. Generated
program timing and compiler cost remain separate from conformance. Full backend/
GPU execution, universal host equivalence and independent proof validity remain
unestablished; `--verdict` is unsupported.

## Historical Phase43 installed checked14 validation

**Phase43 checked14 was installed and verified.** All 42 ordinary/relocated CLI
checks, 15 postinstallation integration gates and 227 canonical source bindings
pass. The selected API SHA256 is
`222902e565253ae20c628301a9191c6d71e47b211f1dc463da4e8eb1b51c86eb`;
upstream remains pinned to `018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`.
This is a checked B1 derivative, not a new self-emitted fixed point.

Fresh frontend observations agree exactly on 3,026 main and 196 broader inputs,
with zero result or extra-field differences. Main outcomes remain 2,525 pass /
497 observed / four shared failures; broader outcomes remain 195 pass / one
observed. Selected backend renewal retains 69 execution passes, eight unavailable
or not-applicable outcomes and four shared failures in 81 rows. Agreement does
not convert the shared failures into passes or establish full backend/GPU support.

All 34 selected mechanism owners pass, alongside inherited owner closures and
154 untimed expanded application observations. Exact selected-image controls
cover ordinary activation, values, aliases, partial application, hostile host
mutation, callback/error order, fallback and deep execution. Their scopes overlap;
these counts must not be added into a unique-test total. See the
[Phase43 integration report](../implementation/phase43/integration.md) and
[portable evidence index](tools/performance/phase43/evidence/selected-release.json).

The 45-point/669-sample generated-program comparison is separate performance
evidence, not additional language conformance. Compiler-cost and source-growth
regressions are explicitly accepted in the [release report](../implementation/phase43/README.md).
Historical qualifications below retain their original identities and scopes.


## Historical Phase40 installed06 validation

**Phase40 checked06 was installed; release verification and all 42 ordinary and
relocated CLI checks pass.** The [release record](../implementation/phase40/release-06.md)
and [final audit](../implementation/phase40/final-conformance/gates.md) close
15 postinstallation groups and verify 227 canonical source files. API SHA256:
`630879d8f030241a1d2c56e97f18f88b5be2070ac45dd02304afd06b3e3c5c0a`.
The pin remains `018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`. This is a checked
B1 derivative, not a new self-emitted fixed point.

Fresh candidate frontend results exactly match 3,026 main + 196 broader retained
reference observations. Main outcomes remain 2,525 pass / 497 observed / 4 shared
failures; broader remains 195 pass / 1 observed. Backend outcomes remain 69 pass /
8 not applicable / 4 shared failures across 81 selected rows. Reference reuse is
verified explicitly; agreement does not turn shared failures into passes.

Fresh selected-image gates pass 36 focused probes, 56,205 primitive checks,
3,759 worker checks, 144 nested checks, 1,129 primitive guards, 15 upstream JS
probes, 23 libraries / 127 points, 40 worker guards / two witnesses, 22 compiler
components and complete 42-byte HVM output. Separately, 154 expanded application
observations pass. Fifteen Phase35, seven Phase36, three Phase37 and four Phase39
owner groups close, with supplemental structural-tail controls and new Phase40
List, Nat/data, mixed-frame ordering and scalar-island precedence owners.
The [integration record](../implementation/phase40/integration.md) gives exact
receipts and overlapping scopes rather than an inflated unique-test total.

New actual-output controls retain complete values, aliases, mutation/reentry,
argument/error order, fallback refusal and deep 30,000-level behavior. Historical
diagnostic assumptions were corrected with versioned tools; their original
failures remain preserved. All 45 benchmark points have selected execution
evidence: 42 retained rotations with exact final-byte equality plus three fresh
ray rotations. These repeated measurements are not additional independent
language-conformance tests. [Performance](../implementation/phase40/performance-admission.md),
[compiler cost](../implementation/phase40/compiler-cost.md) and release validation
remain separate decisions.

Full backend/GPU, universal host equivalence and independent proof validity
remain unestablished; `--verdict` is unsupported. The previous
[Phase39 release](../implementation/phase39/release-05.md) and older evidence below
retain their original source/API and test scopes.

## Historical Phase37 installed03 validation

**Phase37 checked03 was installed; release verification and all 42 ordinary/
relocated CLI checks pass.** The
[Phase37 release record](../implementation/phase37/release-03.md) and
[final gate closure](../implementation/phase37/final-conformance/gates.md) close
all 15 postinstallation audit groups, with 227 canonical files matching the
checked snapshot. The installed API SHA256 is
`ea5db4a2857ffddce8263406041f56acc9b613754660d7a20c6b7c58682c86a1`;
the pin remains `018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`.
The image is a checked B1 derivative, not a new self-emitted fixed point.

The [new owner closure](../implementation/phase37/optimizer/final-scope-owner-report.md)
passes on fresh actual checked03 emissions, verifying 710 file identities and
15 pinned Git provenance blobs:

| New owner group | Passed observations |
| --- | ---: |
| Exact private F32-to-U32 conversion | 44 oracle rows / 57 boundaries / seven admission records |
| Shared DataView guard | 22 prototype/instance observations |
| Finite private selectors | 154 oracle rows / nine admission records / 76 boundaries |

Finite controls observe all five intended selectors, complete tree aliases and
two 30,000-step self/mutual tail cycles. Each cycle has one outer proof owner,
a terminal selector entry and an inactive proof after completion. Native and
DataView controls retain mutation callbacks, errors, argument order and reentry.
Rejected fixture/control versions and a failed provenance audit remain preserved;
their successful successors are separately bound.

The expanded untimed gate also passes **154 executions**: 45 catalog points plus
32 small application controls, each run by checked03 and pinned TypeScript.
All 45 final performance points pass their frozen output checks in 669 samples;
those repeated timings are not 669 independent language-conformance tests.
The [phase report](../implementation/phase37/README.md) and
[execution table](../implementation/phase37/execution/report.md) retain coverage
limitations, performance tradeoffs and the unchanged fifteen-point catalog.

Fresh execution agrees exactly with the pinned TypeScript reference on **3,026
main + 196 broader frontend observations**, with no behavioral or additional-field
differences. Main raw outcomes remain **2,525 pass / 497 observed / 4 shared
failures**; broader remains **195 pass / 1 observed**. The reference acquisition
is reused with identity verification, not presented as a new TypeScript run.
The backend pilot retains **69 pass / 8 not applicable / 4 shared failures**
across 81 selected rows; exact agreement does not turn shared failures into passes.

All fifteen inherited Phase35 owner groups pass freshly on the installed API.
The seven Phase36 owner groups also pass on fresh actual checked emissions:
ray/column public behavior, scoped proof lifetime, Error reentry, native-array
refusal, producer fixtures, independent complete-tree/alias checks and producer
selectors. Their separate
[successor audit](../implementation/phase37/inherited-owner-audit-repair.md)
closes all seven groups, verifying 678 file identities and 15 pinned Git blobs.
It preserves the first closer's path-namespace failure and all original semantic
assertions. The three new Phase37 groups retain the independent closure above;
these overlapping counts must not be summed as unique language tests.

Fresh inherited gates also pass 36 focused probes, 56,205 primitive checks,
3,759 worker checks, 144 nested checks, 1,129 primitive guards, 15 upstream JS
probes, 23 libraries/127 points, 40 worker guards/two witnesses, 22 compiler
components and complete 42-byte HVM output. The installed/relocated CLI gate
includes JavaScript and native CPU execution, with no upstream checkout supplied
to the relocated image. Historical outcomes below retain their original artifacts.

Full backend/GPU, universal host equivalence and independent proof validity
remain unestablished; `--verdict` is unsupported. Correctness,
[performance admission](../implementation/phase37/performance-admission.md),
[compiler cost](../implementation/phase37/compiler-cost.md) and installed-release
validation retain separate evidence.

## Historical Phase36 installed03 validation

**Phase36 checked03 was installed, release verification passed, and all 42
ordinary/relocated CLI checks passed.** Its final postinstall audit closes all **15 groups**,
following all 38 preinstall steps, with **226 canonical files** matching the
checked snapshot. Its API SHA256 is
`93e55ad7ee456eebb5fa3dd9606c2cf262ea386c6f66bfd891ffe187d8f50a75`;
the upstream pin remains `018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`.
The [release report](../implementation/phase36/release-03.md) and
[final audit](../implementation/phase36/final-conformance/gates.md) bind these
results to the installed compiler. The selected image remains a checked B1
derivative, not a new self-emitted fixed point. See the
[Phase36 report](../implementation/phase36/README.md) for the separate performance
admission and preserved experiment outcomes.

Fresh candidate execution agrees exactly with the retained pinned TypeScript
reference on **3,026 main and 196 broader frontend observations**, with zero
behavioral or additional-field differences. Main raw outcomes remain **2,525
pass / 497 observed / 4 shared failures**; broader remains **195 pass / 1
observed**. Reference acquisition is reused with identity verification, not
presented as a new TypeScript run. Exact agreement does not relabel shared
failures as fixture passes.

The fresh backend pilot preserves all **81 historical outcomes: 69 pass, 8 not
applicable and 4 shared failures**. Its scope is selected JavaScript/native CPU
coverage. Full backend/GPU coverage and the optional 811-case JS expansion remain
separate, uncompleted scopes.

The final API passes **seven new Phase36 owner groups**, independently bound to
actual checked emissions by the
[owner closure](../implementation/phase36/owner-closure-protocol.md):

| Owner group | Passed observations |
|---|---:|
| Actual ray/column public behavior | 57 oracle rows / 200 boundaries |
| Scoped proof entry and cleanup | 10 observations |
| Native Succ overflow and Error callback reentry | 16 oracle rows / 4 boundaries |
| Native-array proof refusal and callback reentry | 16 oracle rows / 4 boundaries |
| Producer fixture admission | 175 oracle rows / 5 admission witnesses |
| Independent producer review | 108 trees / 36 aliases / 9 entries / 27 boundaries / 3 structural checks |
| Producer-context Nat/Bool selectors | 243 oracle rows / 10 admission witnesses / 6 boundaries |

These results are recorded in `selfhost/build/phase36/owner-close03/report.json`,
with [guard identities](../implementation/phase36/guard-actual-summary.json) and
[producer evidence](../implementation/phase36/producer-checked03-evidence.json).
Whole-root purity is required before scoped proof reuse; the actual native-array
fixture retains its earlier private tree while refusing proof sharing. Error
callbacks see inactive proof and observe mutations during reentry. Producer
admission and selector controls execute the compiler's emitted workers, with
separate refusal and public-boundary observations.

**The 15 inherited Phase35 owner groups are a separate gate**, freshly executed
on checked03: pair/fold state and ordered native events, argument/read order,
lexical scope, aliases/nested loops, counter admission and hooks, finite Nat/F32
and branch regions, independent purity, ray/column traversal and recursive folds.
The 14-group preinstall audit includes this inherited gate; the seven new
Phase36 groups retain their own explicit closure. Their counts overlap and must
not be summed as unique conformance tests.

Fresh inherited gates also pass **36 focused exact probes, 56,205 primitive
checks, 3,759 worker checks, 144 nested checks, 1,129 primitive guards, 15 selected
upstream JS probes, 23 libraries/127 points, 40 worker guards/two witnesses,
22 compiler components and complete 42-byte HVM output**. The 42 installed/
relocated CLI checks include generated JavaScript and native CPU execution with
Clang16; the relocated compiler runs without an upstream checkout. Phase36
acquisition and parser failures remain preserved beside explicit successful
successors. The historical audit-repair failures described below belong to
Phase35: Phase36's preinstall audit passed on its first use of the corrected
inherited auditor, retaining strict final candidate identity and behavioral
assertions.

These finite gates do not establish universal JavaScript-host equivalence:
host controls retain their standard-at-import and named post-import mutation
scope. They also establish no full backend/GPU, new H image, fixed point or
independent proof-kernel result. `--verdict` remains unsupported. Correctness,
performance admission and installed release validation retain separate evidence.

## Historical Phase35 installed09 validation

**Checked09 is installed, release verification passes, and all 42 ordinary/
relocated CLI checks pass.** API SHA256 is
`467bc7dec2751a94cb677c5eb2da22a8fb69ee3522c6e164cb2bfcc147a78d82`.
The [release report](../implementation/phase35/release-09.md),
[installation receipt](../implementation/phase35/release-installation.json) and
[final audit](../implementation/phase35/final-conformance/gates.md) close all
14 preinstall groups plus installed CLI, with **225 canonical files** matching
the checked attempt. The selected API is a checked B1 derivative; it is not a
new self-emitted fixed point.

Fresh candidate execution agrees exactly with the frozen pinned TypeScript
reference on **3,026 main and 196 broader frontend observations**, with zero
behavioral or additional-field differences and healthy serial workers. Main
outcomes remain **2,525 pass / 497 observed / 4 shared failures**; broader remains
**195 pass / 1 observed**. Reference acquisition was reused with identity checks,
not described as a fresh TypeScript run. Shared failures remain failures.

The fresh backend pilot preserves all **81 historical rows: 69 pass, 8 not
applicable, 4 shared failures**. No native retry was needed in this phase's
approved execution context. This is selected JavaScript/native CPU coverage,
not full backend or GPU coverage. The optional 811-case JS expansion remains deferred.

Checked09 passes 36 focused exact probes and **15 new owner groups**: complete
pair/fold state, 328,966 ordered native events, argument/read order, lexical scope,
public vectors/aliases, nested loops, Number counter admission/refusal and hooks,
finite Nat/F32/branch controls, partial regions and independent purity graphs,
actual ray/column traversal, and recursive folds. Fold controls include 675 small
comparisons, two deep points (up to 50,000 nodes), 57 boundaries, 24 recognizer
cases and actual optimization witnesses. Counts overlap and must not be summed
as unique tests. Host controls have their documented standard-initialization and
named post-import-mutation scope, not universal JavaScript-host equivalence.

Fresh inherited gates pass **56,205 primitive checks, 3,759 worker checks, 144
nested checks, 1,129 primitive guards, 15 selected upstream JS probes, 23
libraries/127 points, 40 worker guards/two witnesses, 22 compiler components and
complete 42-byte HVM output**. Ordinary/relocated CLI checks include JS and native
CPU execution using Clang16; relocation supplies no upstream checkout.

The initial owner acquisition stopped on sandbox `spawnSync git` EPERM. Its
separate approved-context retry preserves the failed tree and all prior passes.
The first provenance audit then found a historical installed runtime path being
treated as a live input. The [narrow repair](../implementation/phase35/provenance-audit-repair.md)
verifies the exact portable reference against its frozen Phase32 snapshot/archive;
all final candidate and source-identity checks remain strict. Both original
failures remain recorded. The final audit closes on the selected installed API.

No full backend/GPU, new H image, fixed-point or independent proof-kernel claim
follows from these finite gates. `--verdict` remains unsupported. Historical
results below retain their original artifact scopes.

## Historical Phase32 installed03 validation

The installed API is
`8be506d811f627fe6346a5eaba07050c36db70e2704608adcfd781b85a3a7f92`.
Its [release report](../implementation/phase32/release-03.md) records the completed
gates and [admission decision](../design/phase32/admission.md).
**Checked03 is installed and passes release verification and all 42 ordinary/
relocated CLI checks.** All 14 pre-install gate groups pass
and 223 canonical source identities match the checked attempt in the
[gate closure](../implementation/phase32/final-conformance/gates.md).

Fresh candidate observations agree exactly with the frozen pinned TypeScript
results on **3,026 main and 196 broader frontend observations**. Reference input
and artifact identities are rechecked; this reuses the retained reference
acquisition rather than claiming a new TypeScript execution. Both gates pass
exact-result and worker-health checks with no behavioral or additional-field
differences. Raw main outcomes remain **2,525 pass / 497 observed / 4 shared
failures**; broader outcomes remain **195 pass / 1 observed**. The four main
failures expect errors at a later emission stage and are not relabeled as passes.
The broader campaign interrupted by a server restart remains preserved; the
successful retry uses a separate output directory and the same selected API.

Candidate03 also passes 36 strict focused observations and six added control
groups: complete pair state with **328,966 ordered native events**, independent
fold oracles, actual typed-read evaluation order, nested lexical scopes, public
boxed records and aliases, and compiled layout predicates. The
[independent local review](../implementation/phase32/review-vector03.md) and
[exact control identities](../implementation/phase32/review-local-gates.json)
bind these results to the actual checked output. Counts overlap and are not a
sum of unique conformance tests. The driver and runtime are unchanged.

The candidate's backend pilot preserves all **81 historical outcomes: 69 pass,
8 not applicable and 4 shared failures**. It combines 60 unaffected observations
from the original candidate run with 21 native rows retried in the approved
Clang execution context. The original campaign's 17 paired EPERM failures remain
preserved and are not relabeled as successful executions. This is selected CPU
and JavaScript coverage; broader platform validation remains separate.

Fresh inherited gates pass 56,205 primitive executions, 3,759 worker executions,
144 nested-Nat checks and 1,129 primitive guards with their separate ordered/
effect observations. The selected 15 upstream JS probes, 23 libraries/127 points,
40 worker admission guards with two execution witnesses, 22 compiler components
and complete 42-byte HVM output also pass. These finite scopes overlap; the
complete gate record keeps each count and identity separate.

The [installed/relocated CLI receipt](../implementation/phase32/release-cli.json)
includes generated JavaScript and native CPU execution, using the approved
native execution context and retained external Clang16 toolchain. The relocated
copy runs without an upstream checkout. The
[installation record](../implementation/phase32/release-installation.json) binds
the selected source, checked parent, installed API and verification receipts;
it does not manufacture a new bootstrap or fixed-point proof.

No full backend, GPU/device, new H image, self-emitted fixed point or independent
proof-kernel claim follows from these gates. The optional 811 additional JS cases
remain deferred. Historical results below keep their original artifact scopes.

## Historical Phase31 checked07 validation

The Phase31 API is
`d8f609c99b3acef932f90040d0c6152c96605493bef926e46f25559ac125029b`.
The [release report](../implementation/phase31/release-07.md) records final
admission and installed status.

Fresh candidate observations agree exactly with pinned TypeScript on **3,026
main and196 broader frontend observations**, with zero behavioral or additional
field differences. Main raw outcomes remain2,525 pass /497 observed /4 shared
failures; broader outcomes remain195 pass /1 observed. Shared failures are not
rewritten as passes. The unchanged comparison gate uses an independently audited
60→65→66 module migration; only `src/back/js/local.bend` is added relative to17.
All other manifest fields and prior module ordering remain exact.

Independent final07 controls cover complete physical arrays and328,966 ordered
native operations, nested records/Sigma, empty records, aliases, public raw and
partial entries, descriptor mutation and prototype markers. A distinct one-array
fold and negative delayed-write witnesses also pass. The final runtime is
byte-identical to the55-case runtime control acquisition; its reuse is explicitly
bound by [the independent review](../implementation/phase31/actual-local-data-review.md),
not described as a fresh execution. These finite scopes overlap and are not a
sum of unique conformance tests.

Fresh final07 passes the15 selected upstream JS cases,23 libraries/127 points,
primitive/worker/nested/refusal controls,40+2 additional worker checks,22 compiler
components and full HVM output. The backend pilot preserves81 historical outcomes
(69 pass /8 not applicable /4 shared failures), combining60 unaffected original
rows and21 native retries in the approved Clang execution context. The original
17 paired EPERM failures remain recorded. Release verification and all42 ordinary/
relocated CLI checks pass. See [final conformance](../implementation/phase31/final-conformance.md)
and the release report for exact scopes. No new H, full backend, GPU, fixed-point or independent
proof-kernel claim follows. The optional811 additional JS cases remain deferred.

## Historical Phase30 checked17 validation

The historical checked17 API is
`33545640e25beffb61639b27f4815aaeb345fda14758e1d63418cd1d0ccc0637`.
Its [report](../implementation/phase30/generated-program-performance.md) and
[release manifest](dist/release.json) bind the selected checked artifact.
Release verification and all [42 ordinary/relocated CLI checks](../implementation/phase30/release-cli.json)
pass, including generated JavaScript and native CPU execution. The relocated
copy uses the retained external Clang16 toolchain.

[Frontend renewal](../implementation/phase30/frontend-renewal.md) on16 agrees exactly
with pinned TypeScript on **3,026 main observations and 196 broader observations**.
The main raw outcomes remain **2,525 pass / 497 observed / 4 fail** on both sides;
the broader set is **195 pass / 1 observed**. The four shared failures expect
later emission errors. No fixture verdict was changed to make agreement pass.
An independently audited module-layout migration admits the five added JS modules
relative to the historical frontend reference, with all other input metadata,
fixture paths, expected results and behavioral fields unchanged. The original
strict manifest-comparison failure remains preserved.
The [independent17 audit](../implementation/phase30/registration-flag-actual-review.md)
proves identical frontend source/API/Base/host inputs. These3026+196 observations
are reused under that audit, not described as a new17 full frontend run.

Fresh [checked17 gates](../implementation/phase30/release-17.md) pass
36 focused observations, 15 selected upstream JS executions, 23 libraries with
127 points, all ten selected original library outputs, 22 compiler component
observations and the complete HVM output. The primitive/worker suites again pass
56,205 primitive executions, 3,759 worker executions, 144 nested-Nat observations,
1,129 primitive guards and 40 worker guards, with their separate ordered/effect
witnesses. New region, tree, terminal-record, exact-entry, public-callback and
full-array controls are linked from the report. These overlapping scopes are
not a sum of distinct conformance tests.

The [checked17 backend pilot](../implementation/phase30/backend-pilot-renewal-17.md)
matches all81 historical observations:69 paired fixture passes, eight expected
compile refusals and four shared check failures. Its28 interpreter and26 JS rows
are freshly acquired on17; four check and23 native observations are explicitly
reused from16 after the unchanged-input audit. The earlier native renewal passes
in an approved execution environment outside the sandbox; both preceding shared
Clang EPERM receipts remain. This is selected native CPU validation, not full
backend or GPU coverage. An additional811-case JavaScript campaign is designed
but unexecuted.

[Checked17 self-emission](../implementation/phase30/registration-checked-integration.md)
produces a new H module exactly matching the independently tested flag variant.
Fresh17 preparation checks Base under the actual H hash and matches a small
positive compilation/output against the genuine parent, executing result8.
The earlier positive/negative functional gate retains its frozen16 runtime-input
scope; it is not relabelled as a freshly run17 negative test. H is not installed.
This is not full H conformance, an H-to-H fixed point or independent proof validation.

## Historical Phase29 validation

The [Phase29 release](../implementation/phase29/generated-program-fast-loop.md)
adds guarded native scalar inlining and a private Nat countdown loop. Fresh gates
pass36 strict focused observations, 15 checked upstream JS fixtures, 23 libraries
with 127 scalar points, all ten original Phase28 libraries plus the HVM program,
and22 actual compiler component observations. Exact complete results are checked.

The [independent semantic review](../implementation/phase29/semantic-review.md)
records 56,205 primitive scalar/ABI executions, 1,129 primitive guards and 25
order/error observations; 3,759 worker scalar executions and 14 descriptor/effect
transcripts; 40 worker guards, two let witnesses and 144 nested-Nat regression
observations. Counts overlap and include multiple emitters. These finite scopes
do not renew the entire frontend inventory or establish full backend conformance.

Attempt03 passed the smaller gates but overflowed during symbolic-regression and
ray-tracing emission because an eager Boolean guard still entered recursive
recognition. Attempt04 uses explicit branching and bounded counts. Both original
programs now compile/run, and the new small test reproduces the failure on03 and
passes on04. Source, failing receipts and corrected controls remain preserved.
The runtime, native backend, Base and pinned upstream target are unchanged.

## Historical Phase27 validation

The [Phase27 release](../implementation/phase27/constructor-arm-prebinding.md)
adds selected constructor-arm prebinding through a shared JS runtime helper.
Fresh gates:36 strict focused observations, 15 pinned upstream JS fixtures exact,
23 libraries / 127 scalar points,72 detailed descriptor/effect/ownership observations,
and22 real compiler membership oracles. The previous numeric suite passes2816
scalar checks and four expected refusals per emitter, plus468 supplement checks
per emitter. The runtime argument-ownership test also passes.

The initial inline variant passed the same scoped semantics but was rejected for
a20% short-window substitution regression. The shared version corrects that
measured regression; all attempts are retained. These overlapping finite scopes
do not renew every historical suite below or establish full backend conformance.
The frontend, native backend, Base and upstream pin are unchanged. Previous
[Phase26 guard results](../implementation/phase26/direct-u32-decisions.md) remain
separately scoped evidence for the unchanged numeric recognizer.

## Historical frontend and broader release evidence

The current compiler targets upstream
`018751270e800bc222a93dad7f257083ee53a5f7`, after Bend2 **2.0.34**. The
[Phase23 report](../implementation/phase23/upstream-graph-conversion.md) records
checked compiler identities, the updated Base and guarded version6 profile,
retained failures and release decisions. The [release manifest](dist/release.json)
identifies the installed artifact; `npm run verify:release` checks its integrity
and lineage, without rerunning conformance or proving a self-hosted fixed point.

The new inventory contains **1,513 fixtures** and **3,026 parse/check observations**.
The final installed candidate03 agrees exactly with the new TypeScript reference
on **3,026/3,026** main observations and **196/196** retained broader parser
observations. This includes all15 added upstream fixtures and both depth32
shared-equality regressions. Final candidate acquisitions use explicitly verified
fresh-reference checkpoint results, with zero behavioral differences, worker
failures/timeouts or changed input identities. The
[frontend validation report](../implementation/phase23/frontend-validation.md)
retains both initial and final compiler gates and their exact artifact identities.

Raw main verdicts remain **2,525 pass /497 observed /4 fail** on both sides:
parse1,016 pass/497 observed and check1,509 pass/4 fail. The four failures expect
later emission errors; both frontends accept them at the earlier check stage.
Exact reference agreement therefore coexists with the original failed fixture
verdicts. No oracle or raw report is rewritten.

Final candidate03 also retains **226 paired history observations and two fresh
6,000-character string checks**, with complete result equality apart from
independently validated host provenance. There is no diagnostic exception.
The unchanged baseline114 observations were reused with verified input hashes;
candidate03 supplied114 fresh observations. Original53/60-request order,4MiB
stack,4GiB heap and generation1 are preserved, with no worker failure, timeout
or recycling. The [history report](../implementation/phase23/history-controls.md)
keeps earlier stack failures and the original acquisition boundaries explicit.

Graph conversion now preserves sharing through the existing graph evaluator;
native and JavaScript array atomics use the existing uniform array representation.
Backend execution, aliasing/ownership controls and installed/relocated CLI checks
have their own gates in the Phase23 report. Frontend agreement does not establish
all backend behavior, independent proof-kernel validity or universal language
equivalence. Independent `--verdict`, GPU/device execution, hub/package fetching
and broader platform coverage remain unsupported or unvalidated as recorded below.
Concurrent ordinary structural array reads against writes are not claimed safe.

## Phase22 historical frontend agreement

Phase22 targeted upstream `b2111cf43244e65f76ddc278ee695e669f720cbf`, Bend2
2.0.32 era. The [Phase22 release report](../implementation/phase22/contextual-conformance.md)
binds the final checked artifact, controls, exact vectors, timing and preserved
failures. That release used the guarded version5 derivative, genuine checked B1, source,
Base, runtime and host.
`npm run verify:release` checks integrity and lineage after relocation; it does
not rerun conformance or establish a new self-hosted fixed point. Independent
proof-kernel validation and `--verdict` remain unsupported.

The full inventory has **1,498 fixtures**: 1,001 positive expectations,
482 validation negatives, 11 declaration-only trust refusals and four
later-emission errors. Eleven additional Bend files supply imports without
independent oracles. The final run completes all **2,996 parse/check observations**.
All 1,001 positives accept types; all 482 validation negatives reject, with no
observed invalid acceptance, timeout or unresolved observation. All 11 trust
cases type-check and reach the intended refusal, exactly matching TypeScript.

Phase22 reaches **2,996/2,996 exact complete results** on this corpus, closing
the final two do-block first-diagnostic differences with zero lost matches.
Phase16 had reduced459 differences to2; subsequent releases retained those two
until the contextual frontend put semantic decisions at their actual parsing
checkpoints. All measured primitive status, phase, type/trust, unsafe-list,
exit and output axes agree. This is full agreement on the tested frontend
corpus, not proof of universal language equivalence.

Strict check results are **1,494 passes /4 failures**. Those four fixtures expect
later-emission errors and both frontends accept them at this earlier stage.
The parse lane retains1,001 passes and497 observed negatives. Exact reference
comparison and original fixture verdicts are separate; no oracle was weakened.

Fresh final-artifact gates also establish broader parser196/196 exact (+57,
zero lost), independent public176/176, check/interpreter/JS/native36/36, and
integration198/198. The marked114 selection is an audited exact subset of the
fresh196, closing its43 historical differences. Header12, normalization12,
completion17, constructor-index42 and actual checkup4 controls pass their stated
contracts. Original226 paired history requests plus two fresh long-string checks
pass with exactly one prospectively pinned diagnostic correction; all other
complete results and the original resource/order boundaries are preserved.
The unchanged standalone frontend test rebuilds26 modules without the checker
or diagnostic tracing dependencies. Suites overlap and must not be summed as
unique programs. See the Phase22 report for exact source/API/host identities.

The sections below retain artifact-specific historical results and failures.
Where Phase22 supersedes a frontier, the current result is stated explicitly.
Independent proof-kernel validation, GPU execution and broader platform/device
coverage remain outside the demonstrated result.

The earlier Phase19 prefix release fixes a separate public-prefix error outside that inventory.
The Phase17 compiler accepts a changed `{0n == 1n : Nat}` proof when reusing a
validated `{0n == 0n : Nat}` prefix, despite rejecting the changed book in a full
check. The corrected compiler detects the changed literal and rejects in both
paths. All twelve identity controls pass; five failed on Phase17. This does not
establish a bypass of the host's separately hashed Base cache. The
[independent prefix report](../implementation/phase19/instance-boundary.md)
retains the original failure and pinned oracle. Maintained 36, the complete
2,996-result comparison and all 42 installed/relocated CLI checks were rerun on
the corrected API; other named controls below retain their stated prior scope.

The Phase19 live-checker image additionally passed all22 saved chronology observations
(two previous differences), all6 let-closure observations (three previous strict
differences), memo8, parsed instances29, canonical keys61, world/freshness/demand40,
and recursion4. Independent final-image boundary104 passes its stated contracts;
its runtime-reference projection is not full checked-term equivalence. Actual
backend41 and literal JS/native20 executions, helper16/authentic replay5, original
paired histories226 and installed/relocatedCLI42 were rerun on that Phase19 API.

The frozen older public18 comparison retains six intentional differences:
instances are checked earlier, checked output uses completion order, and failure
results retain the actual failing world. Its overall report remains failed.
All nine stable four-field/projection-demand rows pass. The independently pinned
boundary104 suite validates the new behavior. See the
[live-checker implementation](../implementation/phase19/instance-live-checking.md)
and [independent review](../implementation/phase19/instance-independent-review.md).

Phase20 also reruns the maintained36 with zero strict differences, decorator24,
constructor50, first-element54 and expanded whitespace44, all exact. Original
supplied39 and ordered-host43 now have zero strict differences. Three new accepted
constructor programs pass check/interpreter/JS/native comparisons (12observations),
and all42 installed/relocated CLI checks pass. These suites overlap; do not add
their counts as distinct programs. A rejected intermediate constructor candidate's
semicolon false acceptances remain documented in the independent review.

Phase16's broader controls recorded the following gaps outside that inventory.
The contextual39 / host43 selections now have the Phase20 results above. The198-observation
integration selection was rerun for Phase19 and now has **198 exact matches**,
closing its same-body live-instance difference. Its immutable runner retains
`pass:false` for14 inherited negative parse `observed` labels; exact result
comparison is a separate axis. Other selections below retain their stated scope:

- Historically, the separate196-observation group selection on Phase21 had139exact
  and57remaining differences, three newly exact and none lost from Phase20.
  Only local-pattern parse/check and local-callee check change. The raw runner
  still fails selected completion with three inherited failed verdicts; the
  separate acquisition/no-regression audit preserves this raw failure.
- Phase21's independent68 improves44→60exact with16gains and no primitive or
  exact-match regressions. Typed-RHS4 adds two exact/two unchanged diagnostics.
  Complete-graph172 and positive annotation-coordinate30 gates pass; inherited
  grouped-constructor false acceptances stay visible. Program12 has exact healthy
  observations, including nine successful actual executions, but the original
  output-oracle verdicts remain failed because their comments omitted Nat's `n`.
  Maintained36 is strict exact and installed/relocatedCLI42 passes.
- Historically, the 114-observation marked-pattern selection had **71 exact
  matches and43 known differences**; Phase22 closes all43 as described above. Its raw oracle report is `pass:false`, including the
  known do-block check failure. A separate audit establishes 114 unchanged
  candidate outcomes and zero regressions against its accepted predecessor;
  it does not establish full selected conformance. Six direct demand controls pass.
- The historical Phase16 supplied-source39 and ordered-host43 controls each
  retained one wording difference for `@unsafe` followed by an import; Phase20
  closes that gap as recorded above. Historical namespace eight,
  term/cache 39 and whole-program host ten controls pass without exceptions.

On the historical Phase17 API, the maintained 36 cases pass their selected contract
with two inherited exact differences. All **41 paired backend rows** match the
pin. The direct frontend-lookup probes pass **23 paired / 46 independent expected
outcomes**, including lazy demand, exact access order and a 100,000-definition
miss. Each probe preserves the entire production API prefix and adds one named
internal wrapper with a distinct identity. The supplied-source 39 and host 43
controls rerun on this API with the same known wording gap.

Phase16's additional **20 literal JS/native executions**, **176 literal
observations**, **29 instance controls**, **two specialization growth controls**,
**61 canonical-key controls**, namespace 8, term/cache 39 and program-host 10 remain
artifact-specific historical evidence. They were not all rerun for Phase17's
single lookup-worker change. All 2,996 complete compiler result objects are
unchanged, but that does not manufacture new execution evidence for these other
selections. See the [Phase16 gate report](../implementation/phase16/checker-compact-final-gates.md).

The Phase17 standalone 25-module loader rebuilds without checker or diagnostic
tracing dependencies. All 16 unchanged derivation groups and five authentic
version1–5 byte replays pass, as do all **42 installed/relocated CLI checks**.
[Phase17 validation](../implementation/phase17/find-demand-gates.md) records the
exact images, complete-vector comparison and gate boundaries.

Fresh long strings and the original 53/60-request histories preserve all
**226 paired complete results**, with original ordering and 4 MiB stack / 4 GiB
heap limits. The Phase16 and Phase17 APIs run under the same byte-identical compatible
host; original historical inputs and host differences remain explicit. The old 21-case prefix can
overflow even Phase11, so the maintained selection keeps the string first.
Finite histories do not establish general stack safety.

New independent Phase17 research keeps additional failures visible. The
[group-boundary trial](../implementation/phase17/group-boundary.md) retains
128/196 exact observations, including eight existing semantic mismatches in
four grouped-comma/zero-head-match witnesses. The
[instance-order investigation](../implementation/phase17/instance-chronology.md)
has 20/22 exact observations and 8 exact memo/name controls, with two distinct
error-order gaps. The retained Phase19 checker matches all22 instance
observations and memo8; Phase20 separately closes the eight zero-head observations.
The original contextual parser prototype remains an isolated historical artifact;
Phase22 integrates a separately validated contextual implementation and closes
its measured frontend gaps. These selections overlap and must not be summed.

Other limits include hub/package fetching, independent proof-kernel validation,
backend/platform coverage and source Nat payloads restricted to U32 size (wider
runtime values have a separate representation). Native Process requires a libc
symbol unavailable on this host, also blocking upstream. GPU execution and
interactive devices are unvalidated. These control sets overlap and must not be
summed into a count of unique conformance programs. Earlier span/control counts
refer to their historical compiler images, not automatically to this release.

## Historical evidence

The following sections describe their recorded old-pin artifacts.

The supplied baseline compiler results are in [the compatibility matrix](docs/COMPATIBILITY-MATRIX.md).
Phase 1 changes have separate artifact-specific evidence in the
[implementation report](../implementation/phase1/report.md).
Phase 2 adds [exact paired checks and retained replay](../docs/PHASE2_DEVELOPMENT.md),
with revision-specific results in its [implementation report](../implementation/phase2/report.md).
Phase 3 adds [persistent frontend workers](../docs/PHASE3_DEVELOPMENT.md),
with artifact-specific validation and remaining gates in its
[implementation report](../implementation/phase3/report.md).
Phase 4 separates genuine checked B1, derived development images, native and
self-emitted artifacts in its [report](../implementation/phase4/report.md).
Phase 5 adds the [maintained checked workflow](../docs/PHASE5_DEVELOPMENT.md),
with source-specific repairs, controlled timings and remaining failures in its
[report](../implementation/phase5/report.md).
Its [final-source checked self-reproduction](../implementation/phase5/final-selfhost.md)
has actual equal stage2/stage3 bytes and matching current/frozen source modules;
this is separate from the supplied distribution's historical proof below.
Selected acceptance/phase checks, exact diagnostics, full-corpus coverage and
self-emission are distinct verdicts; none substitutes for the others.
The complete pinned corpus contains 1,378 fixtures across 24 namespaces; all 919
positive fixtures parsed and passed checking in the recorded full run. Exact
execution results, diagnostic differences, timeouts and hardware gates are
reported separately, with artifact hashes.

- [Component verification](dist/component-report.json) checks the assembled Bend source and compiler subsystems.
- [Negative-test audit](docs/NEGATIVE-COMPATIBILITY.md) separates presentation differences, different rejection rules/phases, and unproven intended-rule coverage.
- [Compiler ABI validation](docs/COMPILER-ABI.md) covers the lazy host adapter used by self-emitted compiler libraries. It is separate from the recorded full-corpus run, whose compiler, runtime and host hashes remain explicit.
- [Typed fixed-point verification](dist/selfhost/seed-verification/report.json) records direct checked seed self-emission and byte comparison. [Earlier failed attempts](dist/selfhost/release/report.json) remain separate evidence.
- [Conformance protocol](tools/conformance/README.md) explains reproducible runs and verdicts.
- [Original prototype baseline](docs/PROTOTYPE-BASELINE.md) and [earlier subset survey](docs/PROTOTYPE-SURVEY.md) are historical evidence for the unchecked compiler.

The typed compiler independently passed its complete checked self-rebuild on
2026-09-21: seed and output bytes match exactly. The recorded comparison uses
the same source and Base path layout; relocated checkouts need a local seed.
Passing positive programs does not establish full diagnostic or proof-checker equivalence.


## Phase24 execution inventory

The active pin has999 positive main programs:999 eligible interpreter lanes,
833 JavaScript lanes and812 native lanes (2,644 total). These are a coverage
inventory, not2,644 newly passed observations. The bounded current-image pilot
and its uncovered rows are recorded in the [Phase24 backend report](../implementation/phase24/backend-census.md).

That pilot found two additional emission gaps despite exact frontend agreement:
constructor/foreign-name collisions were incorrectly accepted, and native
function-name normalization rejected distinct import names. Phase24 adds the
shared emission check and injective function identifiers. The four fixtures with
later-emission errors still retain their matching raw frontend oracle failures;
the execution tests validate the actual refusal boundary separately.

[Environment results](../implementation/phase24/backend-environment.md) acquire
the two previously blocked TCP comparisons using unchanged upstream emissions
under Bun1.2.22 and unchanged candidate emissions under Node24. This is a supported
host comparison, not Node support for upstream's bun:ffi or general Bun support
for our runtime. Matching Clang16 TSan runs eight saved emitted-program executions
without sanitizer diagnostics, including a two-core shared atomic witness; these
are finite controls on Phase23 emissions, not a universal race-safety guarantee.
Independent kernel, GPU/device and complete execution-corpus coverage remain open.
